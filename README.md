# Here would be tasks from job interviews and solutions for them if I would find beautiful one.

## 1. Brackets validator

Task is to write function that would validate brackets, so here some examples:
```
    "(()())", // valid
    "()()", // valid
    "((()())())", // valid
    ")((()", // invalid
    "())" //invalid
    "(())())" //invalid
```
